        "descriptionShort": "One of the prominent architects of Europe of the XX century, whose artistic heritage had a significant impact on the development of modern architecture. His architectural works greatly influenced the formation of the image of Minsk and are examples of Belarusian architecture. Born in 1882 in the town of Belsk in the Jewish family of Hirsch Langbard. His father saw the future for his son in commerce, but Joseph from childhood loved to draw. Brilliantly graduating in 1901, a local gymnasium, he entered the architectural department of the Odessa Art School. In 1906 he graduated from the architectural department of the Odessa Art School, and in 1907 he moved to St. Petersburg, where he successfully passed the exams at the Higher Art School at the Imperial Academy of Arts at the Faculty of Architecture. I learned seven years in St. Petersburg (1907-1914). Among the teachers of Langbard was the famous Alexander Pomerantsev (he designed the building of the GUM in Moscow). It was under his leadership that Langbard in 1914 defended his graduation project “The building of the State Council.” During World War I, Langbard worked at the front as head of the engineering detachment. Under his leadership, at that time, the Zemstvo government in Kostroma, the agricultural museum and the theater of miniatures in Petrograd stand up. At the end of the war, he became the executor of the work of the construction office at the health department in Petrograd.",
